This project contains a comprehensive set of 30 SQL queries aimed at analyzing the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches dataset. The queries are written for a dataset stored in a table called matches and are designed to extract meaningful insights about team performances, match outcomes, venues, and player statistics.

What You’ll Find in This Repository This analysis covers:

Match filtering: Retrieve matches by city, year, or venue.

Team performance: Identify teams with the most wins, toss wins, or best performances in specific cities or seasons.

Match outcomes: Examine results based on run/wicket margins, super overs, or toss decisions.

Player statistics: Highlight players with multiple ‘Player of the Match’ awards.

Venue insights: Understand match frequency and average target runs by venue.

Time-based trends: Analyze matches over seasons, weekends, and chronological gaps between games.
